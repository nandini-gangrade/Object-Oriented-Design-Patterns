# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming and Design Patterns

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic. Objects represent real-world entities, encapsulating both data (attributes) and behavior (methods). OOP promotes code **reusability, modularity, and maintainability**, making it a preferred choice for scalable software development.

Object-Oriented Design Patterns build on OOP principles to provide **proven solutions to recurring software design problems**. These patterns standardize best practices, helping developers create robust, flexible, and efficient applications.

This repository serves as a **comprehensive guide** to various **Object-Oriented Design Patterns**, categorized into **Creational, Structural, and Behavioral** patterns. Each pattern includes **detailed explanations and implementations in Java, Python, and JavaScript**.

## Key Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming

| Concept             | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Encapsulation**  | Bundling data and methods together while restricting direct access. |
| **Abstraction**    | Hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary functionality. |
| **Inheritance**    | Allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. |
| **Polymorphism**   | Enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class while executing specific behaviors. |

These principles form the foundation of design patterns, ensuring well-structured and maintainable code.

## Why Learn Design Patterns?
| Benefit                 | Description |

## Categories of Object-Oriented Design Patterns
Design patterns are grouped into three primary categories:

### **üîπ Creational Design Patterns**
These patterns focus on **object creation mechanisms**, increasing flexibility and reusability.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Singleton**  | Ensures a class has only one instance with a global access point. |
| **Factory**  | Provides an interface for creating objects without specifying concrete classes. |
| **Builder**  | Separates object construction from its representation. |
| **Prototype**  | Creates new objects by cloning existing ones. |
| **Abstract Factory**  | Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. |


### **üîπ Structural Design Patterns**
These patterns simplify the **composition of objects and structures** while maintaining flexibility and efficiency.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Adapter**  | Enables incompatible interfaces to work together. |
| **Composite**  | Organizes objects into tree structures for hierarchical representation. |
| **Decorator**  | Dynamically extends the functionality of objects. |
| **Facade**  | Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. |
| **Proxy**  | Controls access to an object through an intermediary. |
| **Bridge**  | Decouples abstraction from implementation for greater flexibility. |
| **Flyweight**  | Optimizes memory by sharing objects instead of creating new ones. |


### **üîπ Behavioral Design Patterns**
These patterns manage **object interactions and responsibilities**, making communication more efficient.

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Observer**  | Defines a dependency between objects, notifying changes automatically. |
| **Strategy**  | Defines interchangeable algorithms for dynamic selection. |
| **State**  | Enables objects to alter behavior based on their state. |
| **Command**  | Encapsulates requests as objects for flexible execution. |
| **Visitor**  | Allows new operations to be performed on objects without modifying them. |
| **Iterator**  | Provides a standardized way to traverse collections. |
| **Mediator**  | Centralizes communication between objects. |
| **Memento**  | Captures an object's state for restoration later. |
| **Template Method**  | Defines an algorithm structure while allowing subclasses to modify steps. |
| **Chain of Responsibility**  | Passes requests along a chain of handlers. |
| **Interpreter**  | Defines a grammar for evaluating expressions. |
