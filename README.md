# 🎯 [Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming and Design Patterns](https://nandini-gangrade.github.io/Object-Oriented-Design-Patterns/)

Object-Oriented Programming (**OOP**) is a **paradigm** that structures software design around objects. Objects encapsulate **data (attributes)** and **behavior (methods)**, making code **reusable, modular, and maintainable**.  

🔹 **Why OOP?**  
✅ Encourages **code reuse**  
✅ Improves **scalability**  
✅ Enhances **maintainability**  

📌 **Design Patterns** are **proven solutions** to common software design problems. They provide standardized best practices to help developers create **efficient, flexible, and scalable** applications.  

This repository is a **comprehensive guide** to **Object-Oriented Design Patterns**, categorized into **Creational, Structural, and Behavioral** patterns. Each pattern includes **detailed explanations and implementations in Java, Python, and JavaScript**.

## 🔑 Key Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming

| ⚡ Concept         | 💡 Description |
|------------------|--------------|
| 🔒 **Encapsulation**  | Bundles data and methods together while restricting direct access. |
| 🎭 **Abstraction**    | Hides implementation details and exposes only necessary functionality. |
| 🧬 **Inheritance**    | Allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. |
| 🔄 **Polymorphism**   | Enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class while executing specific behaviors. |

These **fundamentals** form the base of **Design Patterns**, ensuring well-structured and maintainable code.

## 🚀 Why Learn Design Patterns?

| 🏆 Benefit        | 💡 Description |
|------------------|--------------|
| 🔹 **Code Reusability** | Avoid redundant code by using established solutions. |
| 🔹 **Maintainability**  | Makes code easier to modify and debug. |
| 🔹 **Scalability**      | Helps applications evolve with requirements. |
| 🔹 **Collaboration**    | Improves teamwork using common design strategies. |

## 📌 Categories of Object-Oriented Design Patterns

### 🔹 [Creational Design Patterns](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Object-Oriented-Design-Patterns/tree/main/1%20Creational%20Patterns)  
📦 **Focus**: Object creation mechanisms to improve flexibility & reuse.  

| 🏗️ Pattern   | 🔍 Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| **[Singleton](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Object-Oriented-Design-Patterns/blob/main/1%20Creational%20Patterns/2%20Singleton%20Pattern.md)**  | Ensures only **one instance** of a class exists globally. |
| **[Factory Method](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Object-Oriented-Design-Patterns/blob/main/1%20Creational%20Patterns/1%20Factory%20Method.md)**  | Creates objects without specifying exact classes. |
| **[Builder](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Object-Oriented-Design-Patterns/blob/main/1%20Creational%20Patterns/3%20Builder%20Pattern.md)**  | Separates complex object construction from its representation. |
| **[Prototype](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Object-Oriented-Design-Patterns/blob/main/1%20Creational%20Patterns/4%20Prototype%20Pattern.md)**  | Clones existing objects instead of creating new ones. |
| **[Abstract Factory](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Object-Oriented-Design-Patterns/blob/main/1%20Creational%20Patterns/1%20Factory%20Method.md)**  | Creates families of related objects without defining specific classes. |

### 🔹 [Structural Design Patterns](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Object-Oriented-Design-Patterns/tree/main/2%20Structural%20Pattern)  
🏗 **Focus**: Organizing objects & structures efficiently.

| 🏛️ Pattern  | 🔍 Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **[Adapter](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Object-Oriented-Design-Patterns/blob/main/2%20Structural%20Pattern/1%20Adapter%20Pattern.md)**  | Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. |
| **Composite**  | Organizes objects into hierarchical structures (tree-like format). |
| **[Decorator](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Object-Oriented-Design-Patterns/blob/main/2%20Structural%20Pattern/2%20Decorator%20Pattern.md)**  | Dynamically adds extra functionality to objects. |
| **[Facade](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Object-Oriented-Design-Patterns/blob/main/2%20Structural%20Pattern/3%20Facade%20Pattern.md)**  | Provides a **simplified** interface for complex subsystems. |
| **Proxy**  | Controls access to objects (e.g., caching, security). |
| **Bridge**  | Decouples abstraction from implementation for **flexibility**. |
| **Flyweight**  | Reduces memory usage by **sharing** objects instead of creating new ones. |

### 🔹 [Behavioral Design Patterns](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Object-Oriented-Design-Patterns/tree/main/3%20Behavioural%20Pattern)  
🔄 **Focus**: Managing object interactions and communication.

| 🧠 Pattern  | 🔍 Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **[Observer](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Object-Oriented-Design-Patterns/blob/main/3%20Behavioural%20Pattern/2%20Observer%20Pattern.md)**  | Defines a **dependency** between objects, updating changes automatically. |
| **[Strategy](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Object-Oriented-Design-Patterns/blob/main/3%20Behavioural%20Pattern/1%20Strategy%20Pattern.md)**  | Enables interchangeable algorithms for **dynamic** selection. |
| **[State](https://github.com/nandini-gangrade/Object-Oriented-Design-Patterns/blob/main/3%20Behavioural%20Pattern/3%20State%20Pattern.md)**  | Allows objects to **change behavior** based on state. |
| **Command**  | Encapsulates requests as objects for **flexible execution**. |
| **Visitor**  | Allows adding new operations **without modifying** existing objects. |
| **Iterator**  | Provides a standardized way to **traverse** collections. |
| **Mediator**  | Centralizes communication **between objects**. |
| **Memento**  | Captures an object’s **state** for restoration later. |
| **Template Method**  | Defines an algorithm structure while allowing **subclass customization**. |
| **Chain of Responsibility**  | Passes requests along a **chain** of handlers. |
| **Interpreter**  | Defines a **grammar** for evaluating expressions. |
